First repository testing, hello-world
My name is Amanda Poteate and I am currently a senior pursuing a Computer Science degree at UNC Charlotte.  I have two rambunctious huskies and I work at Olive Garden.  My favorite animal is a sloth.  I recently started watching Anime and it has become my favorite genre.
